Node.js Knockout!!
==================

Node.js Knockout is a 48 hour hackathon, like [Rails Rumble]. Follow
[@node_knockout] for updates.

This is the website code for <http://nodeknockout.com>. It was written before a
lot of the libraries it uses (e.g. [express], [Connect], even [npm]) were
mature. So, it's pretty gross. If you want a lesson in how to get things done,
but as quickly and hackily as possible, you're in the right place.

We'll likely throw all of this out by next year.
