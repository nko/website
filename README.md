Node.js Knockout!!
==================

Node.js Knockout is a 48 hour hackathon, like [Rails Rumble]. Follow
[@node_knockout] for updates.

This is the website code for <nodeknockout.com>. It was written before a lot of
the libraries it uses (e.g. [Express], [Connect], even [npm]) were mature. So,
it's pretty gross. If you want a lesson in how to get things done, but as
quickly and hackily as possible, you're in the right place.

We'll likely throw all of this out by next year.
